For our positions we look for people who have a passion for problem solving, 
learning, and the willingness to experiment with new ideas and technologies.

All positions are located in Cambridge, MA, USA. 

*Prospective PhD students* If you are looking for PhD positions, please apply to 
the graduate programs at MIT or Harvard. We do not accept any PhD student

and welcome rotation students from MIT or Harvard.

with us, please open an issue describing your interests in this GitHub repo:

UROP projects. We work through the Quest Initiative or with other faculty for 
such projects. Feel free to get in touch with us.
